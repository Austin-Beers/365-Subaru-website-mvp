# Subaru app summary and explanaition

This Application allows users to search for subaru items from muiltible api's in one location, esentially making it easer to find the part/ accessory/ apparel piece they want. From the first picture (the start page), you can navigate to either the parts or accesories/apparel section by clicking either the top right or bottom right button (depending on your veiw-port). From there, it brings you to either the parts or AA page which essentially operate/look the same as shown in the second and third picture. If a term is searched you can see from the 3rd and 4th picture that it displays the amount of results and the resulting items within the cooresponding api. At the top of both search pages you can escape from the page by clicking the "previous page" button at the top.
